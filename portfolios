cd Documents // navigates from home to "Documents" foldermkdir portfolios // creates "portfolios" folder inside Documentscd portfolios // navigates inside the created folder "portfolios"// Bonus: To run all the above commands at once it would be
cd Documents && mkdir portfolios && cd portfolios// Or even more advanced (I won't recommend for beginners)
mkdir -p Documents/portfolios && cd Documents/portfolios
